The rationale for this is because modern data science analytical approaches like machine/deep learning or artificial intelligence, as well as digital twinning, promise to give data insights, enable informed decision-making, and facilitate rich interactions among stakeholders.The benefits of data visualisation, data science, and digital twinning technologies motivate this book, which exhibits and presents numerous developed and advanced data science and visualisation approaches. Chapters cover such topics as deep learning techniques, web and dashboard-based visualisations during the COVID pandemic, 3D modelling of trees for mobile communications, digital twinning in the mining industry, data science libraries, and potential areas of future data science development.',\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'Regulations that cover the legal obligations that manufacturers are bound to are essential for keeping the general public safe. Companies need to follow the regulations in order to bring their products to market. A good understanding of the regulations and the regulatory pathway defines how fast and at what cost the manufacturer can introduce innovations to the market. Regulatory technology and data science can lead to new regulatory processes and evidence in the medical field. It can equip stakeholders with unique tools that can make regulatory decisions more objective, efficient, and accurate. This book describes the latest research within the broader domain of Medical Regulatory Technology (MedRegTech). It covers concepts such as the complexity and user-friendliness of medical device regulations, novel algorithms for regulatory navigation, descriptive datasets from a health service provider, regulatory data science techniques, and considerations of the environmental impacts within a national health service. This book brings all these aspects together to offer an introduction into MedRegTech research. In the long term, these technologies and methods will help optimize the regulatory strategy for individual healthcare innovations and revolutionize the way we engage with regulatory services.',\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': \"A new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism. Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought. Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.” Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed.\",\n",

The delivery of health services is being revolutionized through the sharing and integration of health data across organizational boundaries. Via data science, researchers can deliver new approaches to merge, analyze, and process complex data and gain more actionable insights, understanding, and knowledge at the individual and population levels.

Thus, the demand for data analysis is increasing daily, and the consequence is the appearance of a large number of jobs and published articles. Data science has emerged as a multidisciplinary field to support data-driven activities, integrating and developing ideas, methods, and processes to extract information from data. This includes methods built from different knowledge areas: Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Information Science, and Engineering. This mixture of areas has given rise to what we call Data Science. New solutions to the new problems are reproducing rapidly to generate large volumes of data. Current and future challenges require greater care in creating new solutions that satisfy the rationality for each type of problem. Labels such as Big Data, Data Science, Machine Learning, Statistical Learning, and Artificial Intelligence are demanding more sophistication in the foundations and how they are being applied. This point highlights the importance of building the foundations of Data Science. This book is dedicated to solutions and discussions of measuring uncertainties in data analysis problems.',\n",

The primary focus is to overview the new and emerging data science technologies for full-lifespan management of Li-ion batteries, which are categorized into three groups, namely (i) battery manufacturing management, (ii) battery operation management, and (iii) battery reutilization management. The key challenges, future trends as well as promising data-science technologies to further improve this research field are discussed. As battery full-lifespan (manufacturing, operation, and reutilization) management is a hot research topic in both energy and AI fields and none specific book has focused on systematically describing this particular from a data science perspective before, this book can attract the attention of academics, scientists, engineers, and practitioners. It is useful as a reference book for students and graduates working in related fields. Specifically, the audience could not only get the basics of battery manufacturing, operation, and reutilization but also the information of related data-science technologies. The step-by-step guidance, comprehensive introduction, and case studies to the topic make it accessible to audiences of different levels, from graduates to experienced engineers.',\n",

Digital transformation turns data into the new oil, so the increasing availability of big data, structured and unstructured datasets, raises new challenges in cybersecurity, efficient data processing and knowledge extraction. The field of cybersecurity and data science fuels the data-driven economy. Innovations in this field require strong foundations in mathematics, statistics, machine learning and information security. The unprecedented increase in the availability of data in many fields of science and technology (e.g., genomic data, data from industrial environments, network traffic, streaming media, sensory data of smart cities, and social network data) ask for new methods and solutions for data processing, information extraction and decision support. This stimulates the development of new methods of data analysis, including those adapted to the analysis of new data structures and the growing volume of data. The papers included in this reprint discuss various topics ranging from cyberattacks, steganography, anomaly detection, evaluation of the attacker skills, modelling of the threats, and wireless security evaluation, as well as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. Given this diversity of topics the book represents a valuable reference for researchers in cybersecurity security and data science.',\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': \"Data Science (DS) is gaining significant importance in the decision process due to a mix of various areas, including Computer Science, Machine Learning, Math and Statistics, domain/business knowledge, software development, and traditional research. In the business field, DS's application allows using scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data to support the decision process. After collecting the data, it is crucial to discover the knowledge. In this step, Knowledge Discovery (KD) tasks are used to create knowledge from structured and unstructured sources (e.g., text, data, and images). The output needs to be in a readable and interpretable format. It must represent knowledge in a manner that facilitates inferencing. KD is applied in several areas, such as education, health, accounting, energy, and public administration. This book includes fourteen excellent articles which discuss this trending topic and present innovative solutions to show the importance of Data Science and Knowledge Discovery to researchers, managers, industry, society, and other communities. The chapters address several topics like Data mining, Deep Learning, Data Visualization and Analytics, Semantic data, Geospatial and Spatio-Temporal Data, Data Augmentation and Text Mining.\",\n",

Topics covered in the first section on data collection include: data sources, data at scale (big data), data stewardship (FAIR data) and related privacy concerns. Aspects of predictive modelling using techniques such as classification, regression or clustering, and prediction model validation will be covered in the second section. The third section covers aspects of (mobile) clinical decision support systems, operational excellence and value-based healthcare. Fundamentals of Clinical Data Science is an essential resource for healthcare professionals and IT consultants intending to develop and refine their skills in personalized medicine, using solutions based on large datasets from electronic health records or telemonitoring programmes. The book’s promise is “no math, no code”and will explain the topics in a style that is optimized for a healthcare audience.',\n",

Data-driven software solutions are different from “traditional” software development projects, as the focus of the main development core is on managing the data (e.g., data store and data quality) and designing behavioral models with the aid of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. To this end, new life cycles, algorithms, methods, processes, and tools are required. This reprint is centered on the recent trends and advancements in the field of engineering data-intensive software solutions to address the challenges in developing, testing, and maintaining such data-driven systems, with a focus on the application of data-driven solutions to real-life problems and techniques and algorithms addressing the different challenges of data-driven software engineering.',\n",

The Editorial Board is composed of academics, spanning from the domain of human and social sciences to that of the natural, technological and biomedical sciences. Their task is to decide through an external peer-review process on the publication proposal by accepting it, refusing it, or asking the author to revise it. If a revision of the work is requested, the referees verify whether the Author has made the requested changes. If there are inconsistencies with what has been requested, the work is submitted again to the Editorial Board for a final evaluation. A new publishing proposal can be submitted by the author, or by a Scientific board already publishing a series in the FUP catalogue. The author’s proposal is evaluated by at least two reviewers through a single-blind peer-review process. The publishing proposal submitted by a Scientific board must be accompanied by the report of two referees: at least one of the two must be external to the proposing Committee. The FUP Editorial board, however, has the last word on the publication decision. Every publishing proposal must be deliberated by the FUP Scientific Board.

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'Mathematical modeling is routinely used in physical and engineering sciences to help understand complex systems and optimize industrial processes. Mathematical modeling differs from Artificial Intelligence because it does not exclusively use the collected data to describe an industrial phenomenon or process, but it is based on fundamental laws of physics or engineering that lead to systems of equations able to represent all the variables that characterize the process. Conversely, Machine Learning methods require a large amount of data to find solutions, remaining detached from the problem that generated them and trying to infer the behavior of the object, material or process to be examined from observed samples. Mathematics allows us to formulate complex models with effectiveness and creativity, describing nature and physics. Together with the potential of Artificial Intelligence and data collection techniques, a new way of dealing with practical problems is possible. The insertion of the equations deriving from the physical world in the data-driven models can in fact greatly enrich the information content of the sampled data, allowing to simulate very complex phenomena, with drastically reduced calculation times. Combined approaches will constitute a breakthrough in cutting-edge applications, providing precise and reliable tools for the prediction of phenomena in biological macro/microsystems, for biotechnological applications and for medical diagnostics, particularly in the field of precision medicine.',\n",

From 2020, the platform will be applied at a regional and national level to various use cases such as urban expansion, forest health, and natural disasters. Its workflows allow the selection of satellite images from data archives, the extraction of useful information from the metadata, the generation of descriptors for each individual image, the ingestion of image and descriptor data into a common database, the assignment of semantic content labels to image patches, and the possibility to search and to retrieve similar content-related image patches. The main two components, namely, data mining and data fusion, are detailed and validated. The most important contributions of this chapter are the integration of these two components with a Copernicus platform on top of the European DIAS system, for the purpose of large-scale Earth observation image annotation, and the measurement of the clustering and classification performances of various Copernicus Sentinel and third-party mission data. The average classification accuracy is ranging from 80 to 95% depending on the type of images.',\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'This open access book explores ways to leverage information technology and machine learning to combat disease and promote health, especially in resource-constrained settings. It focuses on digital disease surveillance through the application of machine learning to non-traditional data sources. Developing countries are uniquely prone to large-scale emerging infectious disease outbreaks due to disruption of ecosystems, civil unrest, and poor healthcare infrastructure – and without comprehensive surveillance, delays in outbreak identification, resource deployment, and case management can be catastrophic. In combination with context-informed analytics, students will learn how non-traditional digital disease data sources – including news media, social media, Google Trends, and Google Street View – can fill critical knowledge gaps and help inform on-the-ground decision-making when formal surveillance systems are insufficient.',\n",

       "  'publisher.peerreviewpolicy': 'As an academic publisher, KIT Scientific Publishing attaches particular importance to the high quality of the scientific works it publishes. All publications by KIT Scientific Publishing Publication therefore must have undergone a thorough peer review process. Since KIT Scientific Publishing exclusively publishes titles from researchers affiliated to Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) the peer review of our publications is executed by the academic community which also is in charge of assigning external reviewers. KIT Scientific Publishing reserves the right to reject publication proposals from authors who are not affiliated to KIT and where the quality of the publication can therefore not be assured. All KIT affiliate researchers pledge to adhere to the KIT rules for safeguarding good scientific practice (see http://www.kit.edu/kit/english/14938.php). The rules state that reviewers of scientific work shall use a transparent evaluation system and retain their independence as examiner/s. This shall also include unprejudiced evaluation. Further, scientific publications shall a) completely and reproducibly describe the results, b) completely and correctly document own preceding work and preceding work of others by quotes and references, and c) repeat previously published results in a clearly marked form and to the extent required for understanding the context only. Authors of scientific publications shall always assume joint responsibility for the contents. Author only shall be a person, who has made a major contribution to a scientific publication. A so-called “honorary authorship” shall be excluded. Neither the position of Head of Institute and superior nor the position of former superior alone shall justify co-authorship. This means that authors of a scientific original publication shall be all those, and only those, who significantly contributed to the conception of the studies or experiments, to the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data, and to the formulation of the manuscript and who approved of its publication, i.e. persons who share the responsibility for this publication. The authors shall jointly ensure that no co-author was ignored and that all authors have approved of the version of the publication submitted. For doctoral theses, apart from the author, the supervisors shall also be responsible for compliance with the rules for safeguarding good scientific practice in use at KIT. The supervisors give the author their comments and feedback after a first review. The author then has a chance to defend or agree with any criticisms or suggestions made, and, if necessary, make revisions to the original submission. KIT Scientific Publishing will only consider the publication of the thesis after acceptance of the manuscript by the supervisors. For KIT Scientific Publishing titles appearing in book series, the editors select which titles fulfill the series quality requirements and thus may appear in the book series. For the _Journal of New Frontiers in Spatial Concepts_, the official e-only journal of KIT Scientific Publishing, articles are only published after peer review by an international editorial board (see http://ejournal.uvka.de/spatialconcepts/editorial-board/editorial-staff).',\n",

In data science, learning to quantify is a task of its own related to classification yet different from it, since estimating class proportions by simply classifying all data and counting the labels assigned by the classifier is known to often return inaccurate (“biased”) class proportion estimates. The book introduces learning to quantify by looking at the supervised learning methods that can be used to perform it, at the evaluation measures and evaluation protocols that should be used for evaluating the quality of the returned predictions, at the numerous fields of human activity in which the use of quantification techniques may provide improved results with respect to the naive use of classification techniques, and at advanced topics in quantification research. The book is suitable to researchers, data scientists, or PhD students, who want to come up to speed with the state of the art in learning to quantify, but also to researchers wishing to apply data science technologies to fields of human activity (e.g., the social sciences, political science, epidemiology, market research) which focus on aggregate (“macro”) data rather than on individual (“micro”) data.',\n",

DBS is the first swarm-based technique that shows emergent properties while exploiting concepts of swarm intelligence, self-organization and the Nash equilibrium concept from game theory. It results in the elimination of a global objective function and the setting of parameters. By downloading the R package DBS can be applied to data drawn from diverse research fields and used even by non-professionals in the field of data mining.',\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': '\"Rarely, but just often enough to rebuild hope, something happens to confound my pessimism about the recent unprecedented happenings in the world. This book is the most recent instance, and I think that all its readers will join me in rejoicing at the good it seeks to do. It is an example of the kind of international comity and collaboration that we could and should undertake to solve various societal problems. This book is a beautiful example of the power of the possible. [It] provides a blueprint for how the LISA 2020 model can be replicated in other fields. Civil engineers, or accountants, or nurses, or any other profession could follow this outline to share expertise and build capacity and promote progress in other countries. It also contains some tutorials for statistical literacy across several fields. The details would change, of course, but ideas are durable, and the generalizations seem pretty straightforward. This book shows every other profession where and how to stand in order to move the world. I urge every researcher to get a copy!\" —David Banks from the Foreword Promoting Statistical Practice and Collaboration in Developing Countries provides new insights into the current issues and opportunities in international statistics education, statistical consulting, and collaboration, particularly in developing countries around the world. The book addresses the topics discussed in individual chapters from the perspectives of the historical context, the present state, and future directions of statistical training and practice, so that readers may fully understand the challenges and opportunities in the field of statistics and data science, especially in developing countries. Features • Reference point on statistical practice in developing countries for researchers, scholars, students, and practitioners • Comprehensive source of state-of-the-art knowledge on creating statistical collaboration laboratories within the field of data science and statistics • Collection of innovative statistical teaching and learning techniques in developing countries Each chapter consists of independent case study contributions on a particular theme that are developed with a common structure and format. The common goal across the chapters is to enhance the exchange of diverse educational and action-oriented information among our intended audiences, which include practitioners, researchers, students, and statistics educators in developing countries.',\n",

As data activities continue to increase in speed, scale and variety, data Science and Data Analytics is becoming the new phenomenon of the 21st century. In fact, Data is considered to be the gold of the 21st Century and “data” is changing the face of our world. The organizations are becoming bigger and bigger and need a large amount of data to process for creating a business insight or intelligence. As more and more companies worldwide start offering products and services online, companies need to not only process information quickly but also to get insight about the needs, expectations, transactional behavior and responses of the customers. This mandates the companies to deal with “Data” effectively. Nowadays, “Data” is in various forms such as; texts, documents, online books, music, videos on number of different platforms such as; social media, transactional websites and many other internet based online forums. \\r\\nThe “Data” explosion is creating newer exciting opportunities for companies and individuals at the same time, it is also creating concerns and challenges.

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'Progress in information technology has fostered a global explosion of data generation. Accumulated big data are now estimated to be 4.4 zettabytes in the digital universe; and trends predict an exponential increase in the future. Health data are gathered from professional routine care and other expanded sources including the social determinants of health, such as Internet of Things. Biomedical research has recently moved through three stages in digital healthcare: (1) data collection; (2) data sharing; and (3) data analytics. With the explosion of stored health data, dental medicine is edging into its fourth stage of digitization using new technologies including augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. Big data collaborations involve interactions between a diverse range of stakeholders with analytical, technical and political focus. In oral healthcare, data technology has many areas of application: prognostic analysis and predictive modeling, the identification of unknown correlations of diseases, clinical decision support for novel treatment concepts, public health surveys and population-based clinical research, as well as the evaluation of healthcare systems. The objective of this Special Issue is to provide an update on the current knowledge with state-of-the-art theory and practical information on human and social perspectives that determine the uptake of technological innovations in big data science in the field of dental medicine. Moreover, it will focus on the identification of future research needs to manage the continuous increase in health data and to accomplish its clinical translation for patient-centered research and personalized dentistry. This Special Issue welcomes all types of studies and reviews considering the perspectives of different stakeholders on technological innovations for big data science in all dental disciplines.

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'This open access book as one of the fastest-growing areas of research in machine learning, metalearning studies principled methods to obtain efficient models and solutions by adapting machine learning and data mining processes. This adaptation usually exploits information from past experience on other tasks and the adaptive processes can involve machine learning approaches. As a related area to metalearning and a hot topic currently, automated machine learning (AutoML) is concerned with automating the machine learning processes. Metalearning and AutoML can help AI learn to control the application of different learning methods and acquire new solutions faster without unnecessary interventions from the user. This book offers a comprehensive and thorough introduction to almost all aspects of metalearning and AutoML, covering the basic concepts and architecture, evaluation, datasets, hyperparameter optimization, ensembles and workflows, and also how this knowledge can be used to select, combine, compose, adapt and configure both algorithms and models to yield faster and better solutions to data mining and data science problems. It can thus help developers to develop systems that can improve themselves through experience. This book is a substantial update of the first edition published in 2009. It includes 18 chapters, more than twice as much as the previous version. This enabled the authors to cover the most relevant topics in more depth and incorporate the overview of recent research in the respective area. The book will be of interest to researchers and graduate students in the areas of machine learning, data mining, data science and artificial intelligence. ; Metalearning is the study of principled methods that exploit metaknowledge to obtain efficient models and solutions by adapting machine learning and data mining processes. While the variety of machine learning and data mining techniques now available can, in principle, provide good model solutions, a methodology is still needed to guide the search for the most appropriate model in an efficient way. Metalearning provides one such methodology that allows systems to become more effective through experience. This book discusses several approaches to obtaining knowledge concerning the performance of machine learning and data mining algorithms. It shows how this knowledge can be reused to select, combine, compose and adapt both algorithms and models to yield faster, more effective solutions to data mining problems. It can thus help developers improve their algorithms and also develop learning systems that can improve themselves. The book will be of interest to researchers and graduate students in the areas of machine learning, data mining and artificial intelligence.',\n",

Based on a geometrical interpretation of probability, information geometry has become a rich mathematical field employing the methods of differential geometry. It has numerous applications to data science, physics, and neuroscience. Presenting original research, yet written in an accessible, tutorial style, this collection of papers will be useful for scientists who are new to the field, while providing an excellent reference for the more experienced researcher. Several papers are written by authorities in the field, and topics cover the foundations of information geometry, as well as applications to statistics, Bayesian inference, machine learning, complex systems, physics, and neuroscience.',\n",

The book presents time series from a multidisciplinary approach that covers a wide range of sectors ranging from biostatistics to renewable energy forecasting. Contrary to previous literatures on time, serious readers will discover the potential of TSA in areas other than finance or weather forecasting. The choice of the algorithmic transform for different scenarios, which is a key determinant in the application of TSA, can be understood through the diverse domain applications. Readers looking for deep understanding and practicability of TSA will be delighted. Early career researchers too will appreciate the technicalities and refined mathematical complexities surrounding TSA. Our wish is that this book adds to the body of TSA knowledge and opens up avenues for those who are looking forward to applying TSA in their own context.',\n",

The dependability contemplates, therefore, the faults/failures, downtimes, stoppages, worker errors, etc. Dependability also refers to emergent properties, i.e., properties generated indirectly from other systems by the system analyzed. Dependability, understood as general description of system performance, requires advanced analytics that are considered in this book. Dependability management and engineering are covered with case studies and best practices. The diversity of the issues will be covered from algorithms, mathematical models, and software engineering, by design methodologies and technical or practical solutions.

       "  'dc.description.abstract': \"This unique open access book applies the functional OCaml programming language to numerical or computational weighted data science, engineering, and scientific applications. This book is based on the authors' first-hand experience building and maintaining Owl, an OCaml-based numerical computing library. You'll first learn the various components in a modern numerical computation library. Then, you will learn how these components are designed and built up and how to optimize their performance. After reading and using this book, you'll have the knowledge required to design and build real-world complex systems that effectively leverage the advantages of the OCaml functional programming language. What You Will Learn Optimize core operations based on N-dimensional arrays Design and implement an industry-level algorithmic differentiation module Implement mathematical optimization, regression, and deep neural network functionalities based on algorithmic differentiation Design and optimize a computation graph module, and understand the benefits it brings to the numerical computing library Accommodate the growing number of hardware accelerators (e.g. GPU, TPU) and execution backends (e.g. web browser, unikernel) of numerical computation Use the Zoo system for efficient scripting, code sharing, service deployment, and composition Design and implement a distributed computing engine to work with a numerical computing library, providing convenient APIs and high performance Who This Book Is For Those with prior programming experience, especially with the OCaml programming language, or with scientific computing experience who may be new to OCaml. Most importantly, it is for those who are eager to understand not only how to use something, but also how it is built up.\",\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'The Handbook of Computational Social Science is a comprehensive reference source for scholars across multiple disciplines. It outlines key debates in the field, showcasing novel statistical modeling and machine learning methods, and draws from specific case studies to demonstrate the opportunities and challenges in CSS approaches. The Handbook is divided into two volumes written by outstanding, internationally renowned scholars in the field. This second volume focuses on foundations and advances in data science, statistical modeling, and machine learning. It covers a range of key issues, including the management of big data in terms of record linkage, streaming, and missing data. Machine learning, agent-based and statistical modeling, as well as data quality in relation to digital trace and textual data, as well as probability, non-probability, and crowdsourced samples represent further foci. The volume not only makes major contributions to the consolidation of this growing research field, but also encourages growth into new directions. With its broad coverage of perspectives (theoretical, methodological, computational), international scope, and interdisciplinary approach, this important resource is integral reading for advanced undergraduates, postgraduates, and researchers engaging with computational methods across the social sciences, as well as those within the scientific and engineering sectors.',\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'Today, the flow of electricity is bidirectional, and not all electricity is centrally produced in large power plants. With the growing emergence of prosumers and microgrids, the amount of electricity produced by sources other than large, traditional power plants is ever-increasing. These alternative sources include photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), geothermal, and biomass renewable generation plants. Some renewable energy resources (solar PV and wind turbine generation) are highly dependent on natural processes and parameters (wind speed, wind direction, temperature, solar irradiation, humidity, etc.). Thus, the outputs are so stochastic in nature. New data-science-inspired real-time solutions are needed in order to co-develop digital twins of large intermittent renewable plants whose services can be globally delivered.',\n",

It mainly deals with two key generalizations of the relative entropy: namely, the R_ényi divergence and the important class of f -divergences. It is our hope that the readers will find interest in this Special Issue, which will stimulate further research in the study of the mathematical foundations and applications of divergence measures.',\n",

This book introduces recent developments in Bayesian inference, and covers a variety of topics including robust Bayesian estimation, solving inverse problems via Bayesian theories, hierarchical Bayesian inference, and its applications for scattering experiments. We hope that this book will stimulate more extensive research on Bayesian fronts to include theories, methods, computational algorithms and applications in various fields such as data science, AI, machine learning, and causality analysis.',\n",

During recent years many effective applications have been implemented and are part of our daily life. These applications have agent-based models and methods as an important ingredient. Markets, finance world, robotics, medical technology, social negotiation, video games, big-data science, etc. are some of the branches where the knowledge gained through multi-agent simulations is necessary and where new software engineering tools are continuously created and tested in order to reach an effective technology transfer to impact our lives. This book brings together researchers working in several fields that cover the techniques, the challenges and the applications of multi-agent systems in a wide variety of aspects related to learning algorithms for different devices such as vehicles, robots and drones, computational optimization to reach a more efficient energy distribution in power grids and the use of social networks and decision strategies applied to the smart learning and education environments in emergent countries. We hope that this book can be useful and become a guide or reference to an audience interested in the developments and applications of multi-agent systems.',\n",

It is based on the idea of eliminating any waste in the industry, i.e. any activity or task that does not add value and requires resources. It is considered in every level of the industry, e.g. design, manufacturing, distribution, and customer service. The main wastes are: over-production against plan; waiting time of operators and machines; unnecessary transportation; waste in the process itself; excess stock of material and components; non value-adding motion; defects in quality. The diversity of these issues will be covered from algorithms, mathematical models, and software engineering by design methodologies and technical or practical solutions. This book intends to provide the reader with a comprehensive overview of the current state, cases studies, hardware and software solutions, analytics, and data science in dependability engineering.',\n",

With tools borrowed from Statistical Physics and Complexity, this new area of study have already made important contributions, which in turn have fostered the development of novel theoretical foundations in Social Science and Economics, via mathematical approaches, agent-based modelling and numerical simulations. From these foundations, Computational Social Science has grown to incorporate as well the empirical component —aided by the recent data deluge from the Web 2.0 and 3.0—, closing in this way the experiment-theory cycle in the best tradition of Physics.',\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'The goal of bioprocessing is to optimize process variables, such as product quantity and quality, in a reproducible, scalable, and transferable manner. However, bioprocesses are highly complex. A large number of process parameters and raw material attributes exist, which are highly interactive, and may vary from batch to batch. Those interactions need to be understood, and the source of variance must be identified and controlled. While purely data-driven correlations, such as chemometric models of spectroscopic data, may be employed for the understanding how process parameters are related to process variables, they can hardly be deployed outside of the calibration space. Currently, mechanistic models, models based on mechanistic links and first principles, are in the focus of development. They are perceived to allow transferability and scalability, because mechanistics can be extrapolated. Moreover, the models deliver a large range of hardly-measureable states and physiological parameters. The current Special Issue wants to display current solutions and case studies of development and deployment of hybrid models and multi-parametric control of bioprocesses. It includes: •Models for Bioprocess Monitoring •Model for Bioreactor Design and Scale Up •Hybrid model solutions, combinations of data driven and mechanistic models. •Model to unravel mechanistic physiological regulations •Implementation of hybrid models in the real-time context •Data science driven model for process validation and product life cycle management',\n",

The volume focuses on the contemporary contours of such challenges through sustained engagement with current and historical initiatives and discussion of best practices and prospective future directions for ensuring responsible plant data linkage. The volume is divided into four sections that include case studies of plant data use and linkage in the context of particular research projects, breeding programs, and historical research. It address technical challenges of data linkage in developing key tools, standards and infrastructures, and examines governance challenges of data linkage in relation to socioeconomic and environmental research and data collection. Finally, the last section addresses issues raised by new data production and linkage methods for the inclusion of agriculture’s diverse stakeholders. This book brings together leading experts in data curation, data governance and data studies from a variety of fields, including data science, plant science, agricultural research, science policy, data ethics and the philosophy, history and social studies of plant science.',\n",

Comment ces données sont-elles prélevées, stockées, valorisées, et vendues ? Et que penser des algorithmes qui convertissent en outil de contrôle et de persuasion l’information sur les comportements, les actes de travail et les échanges ? Les big data sont-elles à notre service ou font-elles de nous les rouages consentants du capitalisme informationnel et relationnel ? Les sciences sociales enquêtent sur les enjeux sociaux, éthiques, politiques et économiques de ces transformations. Mais elles sont elles aussi de plus en plus consommatrices de données numériques de masse. Cet ouvrage collectif explore l’expansion de la traçabilité numérique dans ces deux dimensions, marchande et scientifique. L’ouvrage est dirigé par Pierre-Michel Menger, professeur au Collège de France et titulaire de la chaire « Sociologie du travail créateur », et par Simon Paye, maître de conférences à l’université de Lorraine, sociologue du travail et des groupes professionnels.',\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'The overarching aim of this open access book is to present self-contained theory and algorithms for investigation and prediction of electric demand peaks. A cross-section of popular demand forecasting algorithms from statistics, machine learning and mathematics is presented, followed by extreme value theory techniques with examples. In order to achieve carbon targets, good forecasts of peaks are essential. For instance, shifting demand or charging battery depends on correct demand predictions in time. Majority of forecasting algorithms historically were focused on average load prediction. In order to model the peaks, methods from extreme value theory are applied. This allows us to study extremes without making any assumption on the central parts of demand distribution and to predict beyond the range of available data. While applied on individual loads, the techniques described in this book can be extended naturally to substations, or to commercial settings. Extreme value theory techniques presented can be also used across other disciplines, for example for predicting heavy rainfalls, wind speed, solar radiation and extreme weather events. The book is intended for students, academics, engineers and professionals that are interested in short term load prediction, energy data analytics, battery control, demand side response and data science in general.',\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': \"Network science has accelerated a deep and successful trend in research that influences a range of disciplines like mathematics, graph theory, physics, statistics, data science and computer science (just to name a few) and adapts the relevant techniques and insights to address relevant but disparate social, biological, technological questions. We are now in an era of ‘big biological data' supported by cost-effective high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic data collection techniques that allow one to take snapshots of the cells' molecular profiles in a systematic fashion. Moreover recently, also phenotypic data, data on diseases, symptoms, patients, etc. are being collected at nation-wide level thus giving us another source of highly related (causal) 'big data'. This wealth of data is usually modeled as networks (aka binary relations, graphs or webs) of interactions, (including protein–protein, metabolic, signaling and transcription-regulatory interactions). The network model is a key view point leading to the uncovering of mesoscale phenomena, thus providing an essential bridge between the observable phenotypes and 'omics' underlying mechanisms. Moreover, network analysis is a powerful 'hypothesis generation' tool guiding the scientific cycle of 'data gathering', 'data interpretation, 'hypothesis generation' and 'hypothesis testing’. A major challenge in contemporary research is the synthesis of deep insights coming from network science with the wealth of data (often noisy, contradictory, incomplete and difficult to replicate) so to answer meaningful biological questions, in a quantifiable way using static and dynamic properties of biological networks.\",\n",

It is directed at researchers, supporting them to employ experimental studies while increasing their quality and rigor. The book provides a complete and comprehensive description on how to design, implement, and report experiments, with a focus on and examples from CCI and learning technology research. The topics covered include an introduction to CCI and learning technologies as interdisciplinary fields of research, how to design educational interfaces and visualizations that support experimental studies, the advantages and disadvantages of a variety of experiments, methodological decisions in designing and conducting experiments (e.g. devising hypotheses and selecting measures), and the reporting of results. As well, a brief introduction on how contemporary advances in data science, artificial intelligence, and sensor data have impacted learning technology and CCI research is presented. The book details three important issues that a learning technology and CCI researcher needs to be aware of: the importance of the context, ethical considerations, and working with children. The motivation behind and emphasis of this book is helping prospective CCI and learning technology researchers (a) to evaluate the circumstances that favor (or do not favor) the use of experiments, (b) to make the necessary methodological decisions about the type and features of the experiment, (c) to design the necessary “artifacts” (e.g., prototype systems, interfaces, materials, and procedures), (d) to operationalize and conduct experimental procedures to minimize potential bias, and (e) to report the results of their studies for successful dissemination in top-tier venues (such as journals and conferences). This book is an open access publication.',\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'A Smart City is the perfect environment to study and exploit the interactions between actors because its architecture already integrates vaious elements to collect data and connect to its citizens. Furthermore, the proliferation of web platforms (e.g., social media and web fora) and the increased affordability of sensors and IoT devices (e.g., smart meters) make data related to a large and diverse set of users accessible, as their activities in the digital world reflect their real-life actions. These new technologies can be of great use for the stakeholders as, on the one hand, they provide them with semantically rich inputs and frequent updates at a relatively cheap cost and, on the other, form a direct channel of communication with the citizens. To fully exploit these new data sources, we need both novel computational methods (e.g., AI, data mining algorithms, knowledge representation) that are suitable for analyzing and understanding the dynamics behind energy consumption and also a deeper understanding of how these methods can be integrated into the existing design and decision processes (e.g., human-in-the-loop processes).Therefore, this Special Issue welcomed original multidisciplinary research works about AI, data science methods, and their integration in existing design/decision-making processes in the domain of energy consumption in Smart Cities.',\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'The Nonesuch is the name of one of Georgette Heyer’s most famous novels. It means a person or thing without equal, and Georgette Heyer is certainly that. Her historical works inspire a fiercely loyal, international readership and are championed by literary figures such as A. S. Byatt and Stephen Fry. Georgette Heyer, History, and Historical Fiction brings together an eclectic range of chapters from scholars all over the world to explore the contexts of Heyer’s career. Divided into four parts – gender; genre; sources; and circulation and reception – the volume draws on scholarship on Heyer and her contemporaries to show how her work sits in a chain of influence, and why it remains pertinent to current conversations on books and publishing in the twenty-first century. Heyer’s impact on science fiction is accounted for, as are the milieu she was writing in, the many subsequent works that owe Heyer’s writing a debt, and new methods for analysing these enduring books. From the gothic to data science, there is something for everyone in this volume; a celebration of Heyer’s ‘nonesuch’ status amongst historical novelists, proving that she and her contemporary women writers deserve to be read (and studied) as more than just guilty pleasures.',\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'The concept of sustainability is important for companies both in the case of SMEs and worldwide multinational companies. Some key factors to help a company achieve its sustainability objectives are based on human resource management. Sustainable human resource management is a typical cross-functional task that becomes increasingly important at the strategic level of a company. Industry 4.0 technologies, Internet of Things, and competitive demands, as signs of globalization, have led to significant changes across the organizational structures and human resource strategies of companies. The increasing importance of sophisticated human resource strategies in the life of companies and the intention to find optimal design and operation strategies for sustainable human resource management were a motivation for launching this book. This book offers a selection of papers which explain the impact of smart human resource management on economy. Authors from 14 countries published working examples and case studies resulting from their research in this field. The aim of this book is to help students at the level of BSc, MSc, and PhD level, as well as managers and researchers, to understand and appreciate the concept, design, and implementation of sustainable human resource management solutions.',\n",

Before these steps, making data available to people and their decision-makers is a crucial point. Referring to the relationship between data and energy, public administrations, governments, and research bodies are promoting the construction of reliable and robust datasets to pursue policies coherent with the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as to allow citizens to make informed choices. Energy engineers and planners must provide the simplest and most robust tools to collect, process, and analyze data in order to offer solid data-based evidence for future projections in building, district, and regional systems planning. This Special Issue aims at providing the state-of-the-art on open-energy data analytics; its availability in the different contexts, i.e., country peculiarities; and its availability at different scales, i.e., building, district, and regional for data-aware planning and policy-making. For all the aforementioned reasons, we encourage researchers to share their original works on the field of open data and energy analytics. Topics of primary interest include but are not limited to the following: 1. Open data and energy sustainability; 2. Open data science and energy planning; 3. Open science and open governance for sustainable development goals; 4. Key performance indicators of data-aware energy modelling, planning, and policy; 5.

       "  'dc.description.abstract': \"How the global financial services sector has been transformed by artificial intelligence, data science, and blockchain. Artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain, and other new technologies have upended the global financial services sector, creating opportunities for entrepreneurs and corporate innovators. Venture capitalists have helped to fund this disruption, pouring nearly $500 billion into fintech over the last five years. This book offers global perspectives on technology-fueled transformations in financial services, with contributions from a wide-ranging group of academics, industry professionals, former government officials, and current government advisors. They examine not only the struggles of rich countries to bring the old analog world into the new digital one but also the opportunities for developing countries to “leapfrog” directly into digital. The book offers accessible explanations of blockchain and distributed ledger technology and explores big data analytics. It considers, among other things, open banking, platform-based strategies for banks, and digital financial services. Case studies imagine possible future fintech-government interaction, emphasizing that legal and regulatory frameworks can help to create trust in financial processes. The contributors offer novel takes and unexpected insights that will be of interest to fintech experts and nonexperts alike.

Algorithms inspired by developments in the field of artificial intelligence today cover increasingly varied fields of application. This book illustrates recent results on coupling machine learning with computational mechanics, particularly for the construction of surrogate models or reduced order models. The articles contained in this compilation were presented at the EUROMECH Colloquium 597, « Reduced Order Modeling in Mechanics of Materials », held in Bad Herrenalb, Germany, from August 28th to August 31th 2018. In this book, Artificial Neural Networks are coupled to physics-based models. The tensor format of simulation data is exploited in surrogate models or for data pruning. Various reduced order models are proposed via machine learning strategies applied to simulation data. Since reduced order models have specific approximation errors, error estimators are also proposed in this book. The proposed numerical examples are very close to engineering problems. The reader would find this book to be a useful reference in identifying progress in machine learning and reduced order modeling for computational mechanics.',\n",

Agriculture 4.0 involves a large variety of mobile apps, web applications, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and platforms, drones, robots, and smart machinery for precision agriculture. The expansion of cloud technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and big data collection are setting the stage for Agriculture 5.0. Agriculture science and natural sciences are further promoting this trend with the development of leading-edge scientific models and platforms, including stochastic, process-based, and data-driven machine learning modeling. This Special Issue covers the most recent and up-to-date progress in all aspects of internet and computer software applications in agriculture, focusing on the development of web applications and mobile apps, smart IoT devices and platforms, AI, ML and DL solutions in precision agriculture for detection, recognition, classification, monitoring, cultivation, harvesting, and marketing; development of cloud technologies for smart agriculture; computer and machine vision methods and applications for drones and smart machinery, and sensors for field operations; diagnostics and data collection; big data science; scientific process-based and stochastic modeling; and machine learning modeling for agriculture, agroecosystems and natural ecosystems. The research in this Special Issue will contribute to the promotion of modern agriculture practices in the current climate and in the future.',\n",

Authors Thomas Sauter and Marco Albrecht draw on a multidisciplinary background and evidence-based learning to facilitate the understanding of biochemical networks, metabolic modeling and system dynamics.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir pedagogic approach briefly highlights core ideas of concepts in a broader interdisciplinary framework to guide a more effective deep dive thereafter. The learning journey starts with the purity of mathematical concepts, reveals its power to connect biological entities in structure and time, and finally introduces physics concepts to tightly align abstraction with reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis workbook is all about self-paced learning, supports the flipped-classroom concept, and kick-starts with scientific evidence on studying. Each chapter comes with links to external YouTube videos, learning checklists, and Integrated real-world examples to gain confidence in thinking across scientific perspectives. The result is an integrated approach that opens a line of communication between theory and application, enabling readers to actively learn as they read.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis overview of capturing and analyzing the behavior of biological systems will interest adherers of systems biology and network analysis, as well as related fields such as bioinformatics, biology, cybernetics, and data science.',\n",

Social and health data as personal data are also subject to a tight legal framework in terms of data protection law. Their use in other contexts requires a deep understanding of the regulations at European and national level.\\r\\nThis volume provides an overview of the current legal framework and an important orientation for the legally secure use of social and health data. The plant makes it possible to develop solutions and products that improve the quality of care. The first part sets out the social law framework for the use of social data for research. The second part provides an overview of how research data is handled after the application of the GDPR and corresponding national adjustments to the legal framework.\"',\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'How is digitalization of the offshore oil industry fundamentally changing how we understand work and ways of knowing? Digitalization sits at the forefront of public and academic conversation today, calling into question how we work and how we know. In Digital Oil, Eric Monteiro uses the Norwegian offshore oil and gas industry as a lens to investigate the effects of digitalization on embodied labor and, in doing so, shows how our use of new digital technology transforms work and knowing. For years, roughnecks have performed the dangerous and unwieldy work of extracting the oil that lies three miles below the seabed along the Norwegian continental shelf. Today, the Norwegian oil industry is largely digital, operated by sensors and driven by data. Digital representations of physical processes inform work practices and decision-making with remotely operated, unmanned deep-sea facilities. Drawing on two decades of in-depth interviews, observations, news clips, and studies of this industry, Monteiro dismantles the divide between the virtual and the physical in Digital Oil. What is gained or lost when objects and processes become algorithmic phenomena with the digital inferred from the physical? How can data-driven work practices and operational decision-making approximate qualitative interpretation, professional judgement, and evaluation? How are emergent digital platforms and infrastructures, as machineries of knowing, enabling digitalization? In answering these questions Monteiro offers a novel analysis of digitalization as an effort to press the limits of quantification of the qualitative.',\n",

Researchers studied more than 25 cases at eight different MRO enterprises, applying a\\r\\nCRISP-DM methodology as a structural guideline throughout the project. They explored, prepared\\r\\nand combined MRO data, flight data and external data, and used statistical and machine learning\\r\\nmethods to visualize, analyse and predict maintenance. They also used the individual case studies\\r\\nto make predictions about the duration and costs of planned maintenance tasks, turnaround time\\r\\nand useful life of parts. Challenges presented by the case studies included time-consuming data\\r\\npreparation, access restrictions to external data-sources and the still-limited data science skills in\\r\\ncompanies. Recommendations were made in terms of ways to implement data mining – and ways\\r\\nto overcome the related challenges – in MRO.

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'To meet the global food demand of an increasing population, food production has to be increased by 60% by 2050. The main production constraints, such as climate change, biotic stresses, abiotic stresses, soil nutrition deficiency problems, problematic soils, etc., have to be addressed on an urgent basis. More than 50% of human calories are from three major cereals: rice, wheat, and maize. The harnessing of genetic diversity by novel allele mining assisted by recent advances in biotechnological and bioinformatics tools will enhance the utilization of the hidden treasures in the gene bank. Technological advances in plant breeding will provide some solutions for the biofortification, stress resistance, yield potential, and quality improvement in staple crops. The elucidation of the genetic, physiological, and molecular basis of useful traits and the improvement of the improved donors containing multiple traits are key activities for variety development. High-throughput genotyping systems assisted by bioinformatics and data science provide efficient and easy tools for geneticists and breeders. Recently, new breeding techniques applied in some food crops have become game-changers in the global food crop market. With this background, we invited 18 eminent researchers working on food crops from across the world to contribute their high-quality original research manuscripts. The research studies covered modern food crop genetics and breeding.',\n",

On various levels, from the decision-making processes of individuals, through to the interactions between individuals leading to the spontaneous formation of groups and social hierarchies, up to the collective, herding processes that reshape whole societies, all these features share the property of irreducibility, i.e., they require a holistic, multi-level approach formed by researchers from different disciplines. This Special Issue aims to collect research studies that, by exploiting the latest advances in physics, economics, complex networks, and data science, make a step towards understanding these economic and social systems. The majority of submissions are devoted to financial market analysis and modeling, including the stock and cryptocurrency markets in the COVID-19 pandemic, systemic risk quantification and control, wealth condensation, the innovation-related performance of companies, and more. Looking more at societies, there are papers that deal with regional development, land speculation, and the-fake news-fighting strategies, the issues which are of central interest in contemporary society. On top of this, one of the contributions proposes a new, improved complexity measure.',\n",

       "  'dc.description.abstract': 'Given the current growth in global challenges, the need for smart agriculture practices and effective strategies is emerging as an imminent issue at a planetary scale. Agriculture 4.0 involves a large variety of mobile apps, web applications, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and platforms, drones, robots, and smart machinery for precision agriculture. The expansion of cloud technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and big data collection are setting the stage for Agriculture 5.0. Agriculture science and natural sciences are further promoting this trend with the development of leading-edge scientific models and platforms, including stochastic, process-based, and data-driven machine learning modeling. This Special Issue covers the most recent and up-to-date progress in all aspects of internet and computer software applications in agriculture, focusing on the development of web applications and mobile apps, smart IoT devices and platforms, AI, ML and DL solutions in precision agriculture for detection, recognition, classification, monitoring, cultivation, harvesting, and marketing; development of cloud technologies for smart agriculture; computer and machine vision methods and applications for drones and smart machinery, and sensors for field operations; diagnostics and data collection; big data science; scientific process-based and stochastic modeling; and machine learning modeling for agriculture, agroecosystems and natural ecosystems. The research in this Special Issue will contribute to the promotion of modern agriculture practices in the current climate and in the future.',\n",
